## Project Overview:
One thing that always got my attention is the wine shops or the wine section in a mall where hundreds of shiny & stylish wine bottles are put together very nicely. I'm a wine lover although I don't drink usually. And it comes in different variety (red wine, white wine, Ros√© wine, Sparkling wine, and Fortified or Dessert wine, just to name a few.), price and qualities. I always wonder how to choose a good wine from such a huge varity and what things to consider (other than price) before buying one. So here we are going to look at the wine review dataset and we'll try to answer the below questions:
- the country which produces the best wine?
- Does the high price means high quality & vice-versa?
- Are certain varieties of wine of higher quality?
- What's the best quality of wine in each price bracket?
